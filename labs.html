    <h2>Processing.js - Snake</h2>

    <p>This is the first attempt at trying out <a href="http://processingjs.org/">processing.js</a>.  The smoothness seems really good. I had fun working on this, although many have feedback that the snake head looks pretty scary (or did they meant ugly?) </p>

    <p>This was a project that we have spontaneously decided to participate in and was shortlisted among 300 over applicants for the 1st Red Bull Flugtag held in Singapore. The objective is to hand-build the wackiest aircraft where it will be judged based on creativity, flight distance and performance.</p>
    <p>I am the pilot where I launched our "Goldfish" plane from a 6m high ramp into the deep blue sea of Siloso Beach, Sentosa. It took us close to 2 months to design, source and build the plane. It is a great experience that I will never forget. Find out more about <a href="http://www.facebook.com/flaskmlpop">Team FlaskMLPOP</a>.</p>
