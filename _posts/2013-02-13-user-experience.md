As a digital project manager, I am often called upon to act as a stand-in information architect which has greatly intrigued my interest in this area.

I have developed hands-on skills on the following:

-   information architecture
-   sitemaps
-   low-fidelity wireframes using omnigraffle, powerpoint, sketches
-   high-fidelity wireframes using photoshop
-   usability testing
<br/>

I always believe in validating first and code later. It is important to get the requirements and human-computer interaction approach right to avoid expensive roundtrip modifications to a fully developed system.
